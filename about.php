      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="about-me">
        <p>Hello! I’m Elizabeth Yomi, a passionate full-stack software engineer who thrives on building functional, user-friendly web applications. 
        <br>My journey into software development began with an intensive full-stack web development program, where I gained hands-on experience creating modern web applications using React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Redux. 
        <br>This training gave me a solid foundation in both frontend and backend development, and taught me how to design scalable, maintainable applications.

<br>Since 2024, I have expanded my skills through additional training in PHP, Python, Java, C#, jQuery, and Bootstrap, broadening my programming knowledge and versatility. 
<br> These languages and frameworks have allowed me to experiment with different paradigms, explore backend logic, and create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

<br>I enjoy tackling challenges that push my skills further—from building interactive React apps and full-featured e-commerce platforms to developing API-driven applications and web-based games.
<br>Each project reflects my commitment to practical problem-solving, clean code, and continuous learning.

<br>I am passionate about creating applications that provide real value to users, while keeping performance, usability, and maintainability in mind. I thrive in collaborative environments, and I’m eager to contribute my skills, creativity, and dedication to innovative software projects that make an impact.</p>
